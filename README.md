About Me

IT Analyst and Computer Science graduate with hands-on experience across IT support, automation, and software development. I have worked in both enterprise and startup environments, supporting users, systems, and AI-driven service desk operations.

I am known for clear communication, strong troubleshooting skills, and improving workflows through automation and documentation. Currently working in an AI-powered IT service desk, with a long-term goal of progressing into IT systems leadership and advanced technical roles.
Objective

To continue developing as an IT Analyst / Systems-focused professional, leveraging my background in automation, scripting, and service operations while expanding into systems, infrastructure, and security-focused responsibilities.
My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
